# NLP-on-Mental-Health-Issues-in-Twitter-Data

We analyse the conversations and attitudes about mental health in Twitter discourse through Natural Language Processing.

# What We learnt!
Applying **Natural Language Processing* on Twitter data appears to be an effective tool for analysis of mental health attitudes and can be a replacement or a complement for the traditional survey methods depending on the specifics of the research question.

# Problem Description:
What mental health topics do people discuss on Twitter? Twitter data to analyse mental health issues.

# Read the dataset

* In order to capture Twitter data, we had to follow the next steps:

* We needed a Twitter application and hence created a Twitter developer account.

* After registration, we grabbed our API keys and access tokens from Twitter: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret.

* Install rtweet package in RStudio environment.

* Ran the script with the API keys and access tokens as input parameters.

* The hashtags considered for this analysis are as following:

#mentalhealth ,
#depression ,
#worldmentalhealthday ,
#WMHD,
#nostigma ,
#nostigmas ,
#eatingdisorders,
#suicide,
#ptsd,
#mentalhealthawareness,
#mentalillness,
#stopsuicide,
#IAmStigmaFree,
#suicideprevention,
#MH,
#addiction,
#bipolar,
#stigma

* We were able to download almost 18K records on a single try.



# Findings , Proposed Solution and Scope of Imorovement:
**Findings**
* On an average, almost 30 tweets are submitted every single second with hashtags related to mental health issues.
* We found the most common hashtag of them all is related to Suicide and Depression.
* Common Negative sentiments for such discussion were ‘miserable’, ‘desperate’, ‘distress’, ‘rape’, ‘pain’ etc.
* Most tweets came from the areas of United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

**Proposed Solution**
* Identify these tweets and provide them with support hotlines numbers immediately.

**Scope of improvement**
* Identifying users who are constantly posting about these negative sentiments and provide them with different help options like anonymous groups, help and support group information, doctors/therapist information privately in their emails. * This might encourage the user to seek the help that they might require.
